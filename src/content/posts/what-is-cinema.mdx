cinema — there is not a word that defines cinema. to some it’s dream building, to some motivation, to some the great work of art, and to some the only way of living.

but to me it’s beautiful. its history, its present and future. it is something beautiful, to be treated with care. to be treated with delicacy. it’s not just entertainment, but something important, something lively, something new.

**it’s the amalgamation of arts** — the music, the chitra, the story, and the people. and to be presented with love, it is its right.
